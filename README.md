### Graph Neural Networks
| Name          | Author        | What I learned! |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Python for Graph and Network Analysis](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319530031)  |  Al-Taie and Kadry  | Getting familiar with graphs and primary ideas behind graph theory. Also I learned working on node level data  |
| [Graph Representation Learning Book](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/)  | Hamilton  | The basics of Graph Neural Network and How they work!  |
| [Graphs, Convolutions, and Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03777) | Gama et al. | Getting deep into GNNs and how the layers work |
| [Graph Signal Representation of EEG for Graph Convolutional Neural Network](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bk6Y0RR8M) | Jang et al. | It has great idea about utilizing GNN on EEG signals |
| [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907) | Kipf and Welling | They explained simply encoding and feature extraction of each node!  |
